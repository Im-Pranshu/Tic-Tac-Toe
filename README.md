# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty squares with either "X" or "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. The game also ends in a draw if all squares are filled and no player has achieved three in a row.

Key Concepts:
•  The game utilizes React components to manage the user interface and game logic. 
•  State variables are used to track the board state (empty squares, X's, and O's), current player turn, and game history. 
•  Functions handle user interactions like clicking squares, updating the board, and checking for winners. 
•  Immutability of data structures (avoiding direct data changes) is emphasized for cleaner code and better performance. Your Contribution:

By understanding this code, you can potentially contribute to an open-source tic-tac-toe project on GitHub by:
•  Adding new features like difficulty levels or AI opponents.
•  Implementing visual enhancements or animations. 
•  Improving the user interface for better accessibility. 
•  Writing clear documentation to explain the codebase to other developers.
